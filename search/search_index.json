However, even if you create a remap file for a content directory, the remapping still will only apply to the core it was made for.</p> <p>Changing controls for an entire core might come in handy if you want to change the key mappings for every game which is run by that core, e.g. for globally swapping B and Y and A and B on a Gameboy core to make default Gameboy controls more similar to default SNES controls and not having to make the same change for every single game again.</p> <p>Remapping controls for a content directory could be helpful if the core covers games from more than one folder but you want to apply the remap to games from only one of these folders.</p> <p>Changing controls for a single game will help you to adapt controls for a single game without messing up controls for every other game of the same core (or folder).</p>"},{"location":"configure/retroarch/controls/#remap-your-controls","title":"Remap your controls","text":"<p>After you made a decision on whether you want a game or core specific remapping, hold F (the function button) and press B to bring up the RetroArch menu while playing the game.</p> <ul> <li>Go to the Controls section and select Manage Remap Files.</li> <li>Check if there is already an Active Remap File indicated at the top of the menu and if that is the remap file you would like to edit.<ul> <li>If the file is named like the game, it is a game remap file.</li> <li>If the file is named like the folder, it is a content directory remap file.</li> <li>If the file is named like the emulation core, it is a core remap file.</li> <li>If the file is named <code>common.rmp</code> it is the default remap file.

My battery seems to discharge faster on Knulli than on stock OS, even in sleep mode or when completely turned off!","text":"<p>Read this before reporting battery issues</p> <p>Due to the reasons explained below, it is not helpful at all to report battery issues based on the displayed percentage. Telling us that your battery lost 10% of battery while the device was turned off does not help, because you cannot possibly know if that number is even correct. Currently, the only valid way to investigate your battery issues with KNULLI is to watch the power indicator LED of your device and measure the time it takes for the device to drain completely. E.g., when investigating sleep mode efficiency, charge the device fully, put it in sleep mode and see how long it takes for the device to drain completely.</p> <p>A: To our knowledge, there is no difference between the the efficiency of sleep modes between KNULLI and the initial version of the Anbernic stock OS. However, experiments indicate that the improved stock OS sleep mode performs better than the the sleep mode provided by KNULLI. Since Anbernic does not make their source code available, our developers are still examining the stock OS to determine what changes they made to further improve their sleep mode. Until we figure this out, KNULLI will only provide regular sleep mode which consumes about 5% of battery charge per hour.</p> <p>If you perceive that your device discharges too fast, there's a variety of factors which might be at play here:</p> <ul> <li>The battery indicator of Emulation Station (the KNULLI frontend) has a bug which causes it to get stuck sometimes. It is a known issue that is being worked on. However, until the issue is fixed, you cannot rely on the accuracy of the displayed battery percentage. Restarting the device or updating gamelists might temporarily fix the issue, however, it will happen again.</li> <li>The battery percentage that can be read from the battery drivers sometimes gives inaccurate readings. Our developers noticed that sometimes the battery percentage reported directly from the battery makes rather large jumps, e.g., from 93% directly to 100% when charging. Consequently, even if your battery indicator is not stuck, the displayed battery percentage might still be a little inaccurate.</li> <li>The regular sleep mode provided by the kernel for the Anbernic devices of that series is very inefficient, especially compared to modern smartphones or similar devices:<ul> <li>It applies a simple suspend to RAM, which means that many components of the device are shut off, but the entire state of the device is kept in RAM (Random Access Memory). Consequently, the device will still require some power to keep the RAM active.</li> <li>The Anbernic devices of that series consume a lot of power to maintain the RAM in sleep mode, which is why you might notice a discharge of about 5% per hour, so you cannot put the device to sleep indefinitely.</li> <li>The improved sleep mode seems to save more power, however, it is still unknown to us how this is achieved.</li> <li>More efficient power management could be achieved by implementing suspend to disk, which would keep the state of the device in a persistent memory, such as a hard disk or an SD card. The device would be able to power off completely, therefore saving much more battery charge. However, the custom kernel provided by Anbernic for the devices of that series only allows Suspend to RAM. We will not be able to provide a suspend to disk implementation until the Anbernic devices of that series are supported by the mainline Linux kernel.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is possible that your battery discharges a little even when the device is turned off completely. It might be a self-preservation mechanism built into the battery to make sure that it doesn't stay charged at 100% for too long.</li> <li>If you perceive that your device drains all battery charge within a day or less despite being turned off, the device most likely was not turned off but only in sleep mode.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/troubleshooting/#q-i-am-trying-to-run-knulli-on-my-rg35xx-sp-but-i-only-get-some-distorted-lines-on-my-screen-what-can-i-do-to-fix-this","title":"Q: I am trying to run KNULLI on my RG35XX SP, but I only get some distorted lines on my screen - what can I do to fix this?","text":"<p>A: There is nothing you can do.

However, don't be scared, as this guide will lead you through the process.</p> <p>Some basic Linux commands</p> <p>In this section, we will use three text-based Linux commands to navigate your data storage and move files around.</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>cd</code> - means change directory, a command to enter or exit directories (also known as folders)</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ls</code> - means list, a command to list the contents of a directory</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mv</code> - means move, a command to move files and directories</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Establish your SSH connection.</li> <li>On the SSH prompt, type   <pre><code>cd /media\n</code></pre>   and press Enter to navigate into the <code>media</code> folder of your KNULLI file system.</li> <li>Notice that your prompt has changed to   <pre><code>[root@KNULLI /media]# \n</code></pre>   where <code>/media</code> indicates which folder you are currently inside of!</li> <li>Inside the <code>/media</code> folder, type   <pre><code>ls -lHa\n</code></pre>   and press Enter to list the contents of the <code>/media</code> folder.</li> <li>You should see that your <code>/media</code> folder contains 3 subfolders: <code>BATOCERA</code>, <code>SHARE</code>, and <code>SHARE_1</code>. The output of the <code>ls -lHa</code> command should look something like this:   <pre><code>drwxrwxrwt  5 root root  100 Oct 29 22:51 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  160 Oct 29 22:51 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 BATOCERA\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Oct 29 22:53 SHARE\ndrwxr-xr-x 16 root root 4096 Oct 29 22:05 SHARE_1\n</code></pre></li> <li>One of the two <code>SHARE</code> folders corresponds to your SD 1, the other one corresponds to SD 2.

The mighty Port Navigators, our friends at PortMaster, have already found a solution to our common problem.</p> <p>Instead of relying on symbolic links, they started to employ a similar concept called bind mount. When put in layman's terms, the difference between those two concepts is rather subtle: A symbolic link is a file that is stored in the file system and points to another file or folder. In contrast, a bind mount simply tells the running operating system to address a file from a different path. It is also a pointer, however, it is kept in memory and does not have to be stored in the file system.

Linux \"mountet\" die Laufwerke stattdessen als Ordner. Das Linux-Dateisystem kennt das Konzept von Laufwerksbuchstaben nicht, es besteht nur aus einem einzigen Dateibaum, an dessen Spitze das Symbol <code>/</code> steht - die \"Wurzel\" des Baumes. Jeder Ordner der existiert, existiert als Unterordner von <code>/</code>.</p> <p>Versuch dir vorzustellen, dass <code>/</code> ganz grob <code>C:\\</code> auf deinem Windows-Computer entspricht. Versuch dir vorzustellen, dass ein USB-Stick, wenn du ihn an deinem Computer anschlie\u00dft, nicht als neues Laufwerk <code>D:\\</code> erscheint, sondern als ein Unterordner von <code>C:\\</code>, z.B. <code>C:\\media\\my-usb-stick</code>.</p> <p>KNULLI ist ein Linux, dementsprechend nutzt es das Linux-Dateisystem.

Der Ordner <code>/userdata</code> ist gleichzeitig auch ein Mount-Ziel f\u00fcr Laufwerke. Wenn du zwischen internem und externem Speicher wechselst, legst du damit eigentlich nur fest, auf welches Laufwerk <code>/userdata</code> nach dem n\u00e4chsten Neustart zeigen soll - entweder die interne SHARE-Partition oder SD 2.</p> <p>KNULLI erwartet alle deine Daten in <code>/userdata</code>, KNULLI sucht nicht nach Spielen, Themes oder irgendetwas anderem au\u00dferhalb der vordefinierten Ordnerstruktur.
